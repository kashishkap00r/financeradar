The mix of commercial + clinical molecules naturally creates quarterly volatility, this is a business best judged on annual performance, not QoQ noise.\n\nThe 40-70% corrections are largely company-specific, driven by product concentration, molecule delays, or execution gaps. Inventory destocking appears short-term, not demand destruction.\n\nStructurally, the bigger shift remains intact, global sponsors are diversifying supply chains, and India is moving from tactical vendor to strategic partner. However, this is a long-gestation relationship-driven business, not an RFP headline story.\n\nInvestor Compass Takeaway:\nWe are in an investment cycle, not a harvesting cycle.

The court had barred VIP from using the brand for its luggage line in the domestic market.

Seasonality expected to gradually smoothen as OTC and ethical new-age mix rises.\n• Receivables remain dynamic due to bulk pharma sales model; inventory stable QoQ. Despite strong topline growth, receivable levels reduced materially during the year.\n• New categories to follow an asset-light model — selective outsourcing (e.g., mobility equipment) rather than full backward integration.\n\nManagement Stance: Management remains conservative in guidance but confident on growth trajectory, driven by scaling new-age brands, steady vintage growth, and gradual operating leverage improvement.",
