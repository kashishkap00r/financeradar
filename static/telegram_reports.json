Text-to-data conversion happened for 5.2 lakh customers. As a result, we generated 100,000 new offers for which we did not have information earlier.\n\n“This capability did not exist in Q1 and Q2. It just got deployed. We’ll be able to listen to 100 million calls next year,” said Jain. He added that loan disbursements through AI-powered call centres stood at about Rs 1,600 crore. That’s ~ 10% of the Rs 16,545 Cr of disbursals in Q3FY26\n\nData converting -- data from those calls led to another INR 325 crores of volumes. So, this is just our first attempt.\n\nOver the next six months, Bajaj Finance plans to invest heavily in its agents. The company expects to have more than 800 autonomous agents across sales, operations, HR, IT, risk, and DMS in the next fiscal.\nSimilarly, in terms of 100% of videos are now generated by us using AI, 100% of banners are generated using AI, 2.7 lakh videos were generated, and 1.2 lakh banners were generated. At the customer engagement level, we have 11 AI text BOTs that are live that engage with the customer. So rather than sending dumb SMSs for 11 products now, we have an AI text BOT, which allows you to engage, interact, and respond to your queries.\n\nThe company has 26 products. All 26 will be live between April and May'26. So, there will be no communication that we'll be sending, which will not have a -- whether service or sales, which will not have a conversational BOT embedded in it.\n\nAt the branch and point of sale, existing customers face match that we're doing, we did 46 million face matches to ensure this is the same customer, if it's an ETB customer who had actually principally come in, giving us much better control over identity.\n\nCustomer onboarding in terms of document -- ensuring that auto-fill of the document happens, whether it's a PAN card or an Aadhaar. There are 43 such documents that the company has now mapped, which an image extracts with a 95% - 96% accuracy and populate data in our platforms, delivering significant productivity for our employees.\n\nAuto quality check of documents is now 41%. As we sharpen the model, it will take us to between 85% and 90% over a period of the next 15-odd months\n\nOn technology development, we are clearly seeing between 25% - 45% efficiencies emerging in terms of the development process, depending on whether it's a legacy platform, then the benefit is much lower, or rather, I would say, none. But if it's a digital infrastructure, then the efficiencies can be as high as 45% - 47%. So significant work is being done.\n\nSrc – Q3 Concall, no reco",

      "text": "**The Copper Crunch: Why AI and Energy are Testing Geological Limits**\n\n​The world is facing a potential copper shortage as the massive expansion of **AI data centres** and global **power demand** collide with the physical limits of mining. With prices hitting record highs of **$12,000 a tonne**, the \"red metal\" has become a strategic bottleneck for the future economy.\n\n**​Why the Supply is Tightening:**\n\n​**AI Data Centre Proliferation:** The rapid growth of AI infrastructure is a primary driver of the massive increase in copper demand.\n\n​**Renewable Energy Intensity:** Generating just **1 gigawatt (GW)** of wind power requires roughly **2,866 tonnes of copper**.\n\n​**Operational Challenges:** To get that much copper from mines with a 0.6% yield, miners must process between **167–200 tonnes of ore** for every single tonne of metal produced.\n\n​**Geopolitical Chokepoints:** Supplies are becoming increasingly volatile due to mine outages in Indonesia, Congo, and Chile, alongside rising trade protectionism.\n\n​**The Takeaway:** The global energy transition is no longer just a technology race; it is a battle for control over critical minerals. As we move toward a low-carbon, AI-driven world, copper is becoming a \"binding constraint\" that will influence national security and industrial competitiveness.",
