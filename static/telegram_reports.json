Here's what actually matters:\n\n1/ The first global AI summit in the Global South kicked off at Bharat Mandapam. 600+ startups, 300+ pavilions, 13 country pavilions. PM Modi inaugurated and toured booths from Sarvam AI, HCLTech, Jio, and dozens of startups.\n\n2/ The big launch: India's sovereign AI models are here.\nBharatGen unveiled Param2 — 17B parameter, 22 Indian languages, Mixture of Experts architecture. Built by IIT Bombay-led consortium under DST. Not a demo. MahaGPT is already deployed with the Maharashtra government.\n\n3/ Sarvam AI went voice-first — launched Sarvam Vision, Bulbul V3, and Sarvam Arya. Their thesis: India's AI future isn't English-first, it's vernacular-first. Hard to argue with that.\n\n4/ Yotta's CEO teased a big GPU expansion announcement with Nvidia coming in the next couple of days. They've already deployed ~10,000 GPUs. India's compute story is scaling fast.\n\n5/ The hot takes were sharp:\n— Vinod Khosla: IT/BPO services will \"almost completely disappear\" in 5 years\n— HCL's Vineet Nayar: \"You must be dreaming if you think AI will generate employment\"\n— Info Edge's Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Learn 10-15 AI tools or fall behind\n\n6/ Global players are betting on India:\nAnthropic opened its first India office (Bengaluru) — India is #2 market for Claude\nAMD partnered with TCS on rack-scale AI infra via their \"Helios\" platform\nQualcomm pitched hybrid on-device + cloud AI deployment\n\n7/ The expo floor was packed with real use-cases — precision farming, sign language translation gloves, AI for special needs education, digital safety tools, and Tata's rural women empowerment program.\nNot slides. Working products.\n\n8/ India's AI play isn't about building the next GPT-5. It's about deploying AI at population scale, in 22 languages, for problems that global models weren't designed for.\n\nDay 1 made that very clear. Watching Day 2 closely.",

Infosys has exactly that kind of expertise across important industries: telecom, financial services, and manufacturing. Their developers are already using Claude Code to accelerate their work and to create AI agents for industries that demand precision, compliance, and deep domain knowledge.\"\n\nSalil Parekh, CEO, Infosys -> “AI is not just transforming business – it is redefining the way industries operate and innovate. Our collaboration with Anthropic marks a strategic leap toward advancing enterprise AI, enabling organizations to unlock value and become more intelligent, resilient, and responsible. From modernizing financial services with intelligent risk management and compliance, to enabling engineering businesses to lead with AI-driven design and manufacturing, the goal is to leverage the joint expertise of Infosys and Anthropic to accelerate AI value realization for global enterprises.”",
