      "text": "Sa‑Dhan to Review Microfinance Guardrails in April as Sector Stress Eases – Telegram Ready\n\nHeadline  \n- Sa‑Dhan (microfinance SRO) will meet in April to review borrower guardrails introduced last year to curb overleveraging, as sector stress improves.\n\nImproving sector health  \n- Stressed assets (31–180 days past due) declined to 4.6% in September from 6.2% in March, per the latest Financial Stability Report (FSR).  \n- Asset quality and borrower metrics are stabilising, creating room for potential recalibration.\n\nKey guardrails currently in force  \n- Credit bureau checks mandatory before lending.  \n- Cap of three lenders per borrower.  \n- Household exposure limit of ₹2 lakh.  \n- Delinquency threshold tightened to 60 days (with roadmap to 30 days).  \n- Borrowers with defaults exceeding ₹3,000 across loans ineligible for fresh credit.  \n- Top‑up loans only after repaying 50% of previous loan or 12 months since disbursement.\n\nWhat to expect  \n- Sa‑Dhan will assess limited leniency or recalibration, based on data and improving conditions.  \n- Any easing expected to be measured and data‑driven, balancing borrower protection with sector growth (which has been tempered by these rules, especially in some geographies).\n\nOne key takeaway  \nApril review signals cautious optimism for microfinance sector: improving asset quality could unlock measured guardrail relaxation, supporting disbursement growth while preserving the discipline gained from overleveraging curbs.",

      "text": "Cipla: USFDA Issues 2 Observations to InvaGen Facility After PAI – Telegram Ready  \n\nHeadline  \n- USFDA conducted a Pre‑Approval Inspection (PAI) at InvaGen Pharmaceuticals’ Hauppauge, New York facility from 2–9 February 2026, signalling an active approval review for Cipla‑group products.\n\nWhat changed  \n- USFDA issued 2 inspectional observations via Form 483, indicating limited but notable compliance points needing correction.  \n- Cipla confirms it will work closely with USFDA and address all observations within stipulated timelines.  \n\nContext on InvaGen  \n- InvaGen Pharmaceuticals is Cipla’s wholly‑owned US subsidiary, used to launch and scale Cipla’s generics portfolio in the US market.  \n\nNear‑term impact view  \n- With only 2 observations and no warning letter or import alert, impact is currently Neutral.  \n- The key near‑term risk hinges on timely and effective remediation; any slippage could delay US product approvals, while clean closure should keep the US growth pipeline intact.  \n\nOne key takeaway  \nThis is a modest compliance bump rather than a red‑flag event; watch for how fast and cleanly Cipla closes these PAI observations, as that will determine the slope of its US generics pipeline over the next 12–18 months.",
