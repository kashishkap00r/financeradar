The court had barred VIP from using the brand for its luggage line in the domestic market.

Carlton can complement Safari Select & Urban Jungle & help Safari compete more effectively with players like Samsonite, Mokobara & Delsey.\n2️⃣ Safari’s premium portfolio currently contributes only about 6% of revenue. Scaling Carlton could accelerate premium mix improvement and support margins, given the higher price realisations in this segment.\n\nExecution and brand positioning will be the key monitorables from here.\n\nIn 2004, Carlton partnered VIP when Sudhir Jatia was part of the company. In a full circle development, Carlton has now entered into a new agreement with Safari Industries India Ltd. which Jatia currently owns.",

With 25–30% equity, the company can leverage the rest.\n\nMSETCL operates over 1.4 lakh MVA capacity and 52,000 circuit km network, though over 40% of lines are more than 35 years old, requiring upgrades.\n\nMaharashtra aims to raise the share of renewables in its energy mix from 30% in 2023 to 60% by 2030, driving the need for grid expansion.\n\nThe state also plans to develop 2.5 GW of round-the-clock renewable capacity, with about ₹30,000 crore expected via TBCB projects.\n\n@Concalls3",

Here's what actually matters:\n\n1/ The first global AI summit in the Global South kicked off at Bharat Mandapam. 600+ startups, 300+ pavilions, 13 country pavilions. PM Modi inaugurated and toured booths from Sarvam AI, HCLTech, Jio, and dozens of startups.\n\n2/ The big launch: India's sovereign AI models are here.\nBharatGen unveiled Param2 — 17B parameter, 22 Indian languages, Mixture of Experts architecture. Built by IIT Bombay-led consortium under DST. Not a demo. MahaGPT is already deployed with the Maharashtra government.\n\n3/ Sarvam AI went voice-first — launched Sarvam Vision, Bulbul V3, and Sarvam Arya. Their thesis: India's AI future isn't English-first, it's vernacular-first. Hard to argue with that.\n\n4/ Yotta's CEO teased a big GPU expansion announcement with Nvidia coming in the next couple of days. They've already deployed ~10,000 GPUs. India's compute story is scaling fast.\n\n5/ The hot takes were sharp:\n— Vinod Khosla: IT/BPO services will \"almost completely disappear\" in 5 years\n— HCL's Vineet Nayar: \"You must be dreaming if you think AI will generate employment\"\n— Info Edge's Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Learn 10-15 AI tools or fall behind\n\n6/ Global players are betting on India:\nAnthropic opened its first India office (Bengaluru) — India is #2 market for Claude\nAMD partnered with TCS on rack-scale AI infra via their \"Helios\" platform\nQualcomm pitched hybrid on-device + cloud AI deployment\n\n7/ The expo floor was packed with real use-cases — precision farming, sign language translation gloves, AI for special needs education, digital safety tools, and Tata's rural women empowerment program.\nNot slides. Working products.\n\n8/ India's AI play isn't about building the next GPT-5. It's about deploying AI at population scale, in 22 languages, for problems that global models weren't designed for.\n\nDay 1 made that very clear. Watching Day 2 closely.",
