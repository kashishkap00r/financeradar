      "text": "Indian CDMO\n\nIndian CDMO is facing a cyclical reset, not a structural breakdown. The mix of commercial + clinical molecules naturally creates quarterly volatility, this is a business best judged on annual performance, not QoQ noise.\n\nThe 40-70% corrections are largely company-specific, driven by product concentration, molecule delays, or execution gaps. Inventory destocking appears short-term, not demand destruction.\n\nStructurally, the bigger shift remains intact, global sponsors are diversifying supply chains, and India is moving from tactical vendor to strategic partner. However, this is a long-gestation relationship-driven business, not an RFP headline story.\n\nInvestor Compass Takeaway:\nWe are in an investment cycle, not a harvesting cycle. The 5-10 year CDMO opportunity remains intact, but execution quality and diversification will separate the winners.",

The court had barred VIP from using the brand for its luggage line in the domestic market.

Seasonality expected to gradually smoothen as OTC and ethical new-age mix rises.\n• Receivables remain dynamic due to bulk pharma sales model; inventory stable QoQ. Despite strong topline growth, receivable levels reduced materially during the year.\n• New categories to follow an asset-light model — selective outsourcing (e.g., mobility equipment) rather than full backward integration.\n\nManagement Stance: Management remains conservative in guidance but confident on growth trajectory, driven by scaling new-age brands, steady vintage growth, and gradual operating leverage improvement.",
